                <h1>API & Microservice</h1>

                <p>An API can be a command, function, or object, but at its core, it <strong>receives a request and returns a response</strong> to perform a task, without us needing to know how it works internally. We just need to know the <strong>input, output, and how to use it</strong>.</p>

                <p>APIs usually return <strong>pure data</strong>, not user-facing interfaces. How that data is displayed or processed is up to the application.</p>

                <p>In large applications, multiple small servers communicate via APIs. These servers handle small, independent tasks and are called <strong>microservices</strong> — they take input, process it, and return output, like a standalone module.</p>

                <p>In short:<br>
                <strong>Every small function can be seen as a mini-app. If it provides actions like adding, deleting, or updating data, that's essentially its API.</strong></p>
