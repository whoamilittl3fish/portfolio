He was very patient with smile to listening to my presentation about myself, projects, skill, etc. He have an aura of the guy have a strong passion about technology. And yeah, he also very experienced in this field. I have learned a lot of knowledge in real use not theoretical such as Git, Docker, Node.js, Agile/Srum, workflow, work with team, presentation, especially how a developer need to think and solve problem. Well, I have two mentor here, Mr.Peter and Mr.Rashiq help me a lot to improve my skills and knowledge, feedback to improve my performance and tips, tool to improve my workflow and efficiency, also feedback to improve my code quality and performance. I have learned a lot of things from them. Not only about technology but also about life from Mrs.NgocLan. I am very appreciate for them.
